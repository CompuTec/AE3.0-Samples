Creating a guide for configuring and validating a `PluginDescription` entity through a JSON manifest provides a straightforward way for users to specify plugin characteristics and dependencies. This documentation outlines the fields that can be defined in the JSON manifest, their expected values, and the logic behind their validation.

### PluginDescription JSON Configuration

The JSON manifest for a plugin is structured to provide detailed information about the plugin, its dependencies, and how it integrates with the larger application ecosystem. Below is an example structure with explanations for each field:

```json
{
  "PluginCode": "Core.Example01.AE",
  "PluginName": "Example Plugin",
  "Icon": "sap-icon://activate",
  "Assembly": "ConsoleApp.AE.dll",
  "Company": "Your Company Name",
  "PluginVersion": "1.0.5",
  "Remarks": "Example Plugin Remarks that will be displayed in the plugin list",
  "ReadmeFile": "README.md",
  "ReleaseNotes": "RELEASE_NOTES.md",
  "DocumentationLink": "http://example.com/plugin-docs",
  "PluginType": "AppEnginePlugin",
  "MinimumCoreLevel": "1.0.0",
  "Dependencies": [
    {
      "PluginCode": "Core.Example01.API",
      "minVersion": "1.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field Descriptions and Validation Rules

- **PluginCode** (required): The unique code for the plugin. This must be a non-empty string.
- **PluginName** (required): The name of the plugin. This must be a non-empty string.
- **Icon** (optional): Specifies the icon for the plugin, often provided as a URI or a reference to an icon library.
- **Assembly** (required): The filename of the assembly that contains the plugin. This must be a non-empty string.
- **Company** (optional): The name of the company or individual who owns the plugin.
- **PluginVersion** (required): The version of the plugin, following semantic versioning. Must be a valid `CTVersion` format.
- **Remarks** (optional): Additional information or comments about the plugin.
- **ReadmeFile** (optional): The path to the README file for the plugin.
- **ReleaseNotes** (optional): The path to the release notes file for the plugin.
- **DocumentationLink** (optional): A URL pointing to the plugin's documentation.
- **PluginType** (required): The type of plugin, which must be one of the following: `Standalone`, `BusinessLogic`, `AppEnginePlugin`, `SapUserInterface`, `Other`.
- **MinimumCoreLevel** (required): The minimum version of the core application required for the plugin to work. Must be a valid `CTVersion` format.
- **Dependencies** (optional): An array of objects specifying the dependencies of the plugin. Each dependency object must include:
    - **PluginCode**: The code of the dependent plugin.
    - **minVersion**: The minimum version of the dependent plugin required.
### Plugin Type

The `PluginType` field in the `PluginDescription` entity specifies the category of the plugin, affecting how it is deployed, integrated, and utilized within the application ecosystem. This categorization is crucial for understanding plugin compatibility, dependencies, and the appropriate execution environment.

#### Conversion Logic

Conversion between string representations and `ApplicationTypes`

The following table outlines the supported plugin types, their descriptions, and acceptable string representations:

| Plugin Type Description | `ApplicationTypes` Enum Value | Acceptable String Representations |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Business Logic          | BusinessLogic                 | "BusinessLogic", "DiAPI", "Di"    |
| SAP User Interface      | SapUserInterface              | "SapUserInterface", "SapUI", "UI" |
| Standalone              | Standalone                    | "Standalone", "exe", "app"        |
| App Engine Plugin       | AppEnginePlugin               | "AePlugin", "plugin", "AEComponent", "AppEnginePlugin" |
| Other                   | Other                         | "Other"                           |


### Validation Logic

- **PluginCode** and **Assembly** fields must not be empty. The `PluginCode` serves as a unique identifier, and the `Assembly` field specifies the main assembly for the plugin.
- **PluginVersion** and **MinimumCoreLevel** must be provided in a valid version format, which allows the system to correctly handle version dependencies and compatibility checks. The versionning maches the [Semantic Versionning standard](https://semver.org/)
- The **PluginType** field must match one of the predefined types. This ensures the plugin can be correctly integrated into the application ecosystem.
- If **Dependencies** are specified, each dependency must include both a `PluginCode` and a `minVersion`, ensuring that all necessary components are present and at the correct version for the plugin to function properly.
  Adding a detailed section on Plugin Types and their conversion will provide clarity on how plugins are categorized and how these categories are transformed and interpreted within the system, particularly for serialization/deserialization processes and NuGet package management.
